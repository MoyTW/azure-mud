  "description": "Most of the workers are busy crafting potions - you recognize the crates they're filling as matching the ones from the [[bar]]. While most of the hallways are blocked off by swathes of alchemical gear, you can just squeeze through to one, with an ornate sign for [[Dye Machines->dyes]]. Or you can return to the [[Guild Hall->exploreHub]]."
