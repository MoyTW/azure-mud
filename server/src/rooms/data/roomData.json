    "description": "Elaborate scientific equipment juts out of the broken display cases of what once must have been a collection of small bottles. The science equipment includes glass vials, beakers, and a vast array of liquids being heated to different temperatures. The fluids flow from one side to another, changing colors and textures as they go, before ultimately arriving at the far end. At that end, a woman in a long white lab coat collects them and sets them up for display. The end result of this process seems to be a display shelf full of labeled bottles, which you could take if you wished.<br/>One shelf is loaded with [[colourful bottles->drinkPolymorph]] of many fun shapes and hues, and another with [[plain bottles of clear liquid->drinkCancellation]] that are simply labelled \"Normal\" in a bold typeface.",

[[Ubizara the Bartender->talkToUbizara]] will happily make you whatever you want, sliding glasses over the table with ease. A laminated sign on the bartop advertises tonight's specials: [[Divine Nectar->item]] (a locally crafted mead, donated by intelligent philanthropic bees), [[the Fizzbuzz->item]] (a non-alcoholic flavored seltzer which alternates sour and sweet), and [[Yet Another Silly Drink->item]] (a colorful, layered drink with a toy cockatrice floating on top).<br/>A self-serve table nearby has two crates packed to the brim with potions. One is loaded with [[colourful potions->drinkPolymorph]] of many shapes and hues, and the other with [[plain potions of clear liquid->drinkCancellation]].<br/><br/>Four areas provide opportunities to sit and enjoy conversation in smaller groups - up on the [[balcony->barBalcony]], seated [[along the bar->barStools]], by the [[stage->barStage]], and tucked away [[at the back->barBack]]. Stairs at the back lead directly to the [[theater]], or back to the [[Central Hall->centralHall]].<br/>",
