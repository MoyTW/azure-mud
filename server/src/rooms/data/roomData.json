[[Ubizara the Bartender->talkToUbizara]] will happily make you whatever you want, sliding glasses over the table with ease. A laminated sign on the bartop advertises tonight's specials: [[Divine Nectar->item]] (a locally crafted mead, donated by intelligent philanthropic bees), [[the Fizzbuzz->item]] (a non-alcoholic flavored seltzer which alternates sour and sweet), and [[Yet Another Silly Drink->item]] (a colorful, layered drink with a toy cockatrice floating on top).<br/>A self-serve table nearby has two crates packed to the brim with potions. One is loaded with [[colourful potions->drinkPolymorph]] of many shapes and hues, and the other with [[plain potions of clear liquid->drinkCancellation]].<br/><br/>Four areas provide opportunities to sit and enjoy conversation in smaller groups - up on the [[balcony->barBalcony]], seated [[along the bar->barStools]], by the [[stage->barStage]], and tucked away [[at the back->barBack]]. Stairs at the back lead directly to the [[theater]], or back to the [[Central Hall->centralHall]].<br/>",

On each of the display tables is a beautifully-appointed array of meats, each one labelled with the name of the local creature from which it was harvested. You can see swords, bags, and other adventuring equipment right behind the shopkeeper, and can only assume he must retrieve his goods himself. He stands ready at the desk, offering tiny sticks to turn these exotic meats into kebabs for you.",

Colorful banners draw your eye to each individual seller, and you hear raucous callouts begging for your attention everywhere you walk within this overwhelming cacophony. A central space is cleared out to provide a social space to gather away from the goblins peddling their wares. In this space you see people of every kind, mixed among performers doing energetic dances, or playing instruments in hope of a tip.",
