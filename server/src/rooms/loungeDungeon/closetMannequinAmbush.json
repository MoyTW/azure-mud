  "description": "The bowties set up a cry, hundreds at once, and then rush you! You slap them from the sky, grabbing and ripping, leaving a path of silk guts and cotton wings strewn all around the glade. Eventually, the swarm flees, silently flowing back into the forest. You stand, trumphant, amid dozens of torn bowties.<br/><br/> Then something kicks your legs out from under you, and you fall to the ground. Before you can react, everything goes black.<br/><br/>[[Wake up.->hall]].",
