You call out, firmly. The swarm circles another couple of times, but eventually the cries stop and it seems to move on.<br/><br/> You realize that you can see the path to the tower of shoes you were aiming for from here. You can [[escape the closet->loungeDungeonBedroom]] or continue to the [[tower of shoes->loungeDungeonClosetTowerOfShoesDoor]].",
