You've gone another few steps when your foot lands on a white square and a Bishop you hadn't noticed swoops in from the far side of the board and caroms into you. Ok, well, you're *definitely* not going to go back to the starting square now; you just slink back to where you were before the Bishop attack and try again.<br/><br/>Thus you make your way, in fits and starts, to the Orb, backing up to safe spaces when you encounter danger to feel out a new path.
